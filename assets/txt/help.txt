Welcome to Bingo Chess!

The game is very simple: you have a bingo card with chess squares on it.  Next to it is a chessboard showing a game on lichess TV.  Each time a piece moves to a square on your card you check off that square.
First player to get five in a row (a "Bingo") wins!

There is one mysterious button, however: the "Insta-Bingo" button.   When you press that, you are betting your ante (50 gold) that you will check off a square next move.   If you do, you gain the power
to remove a check from any of your opponent's squares!  Additionally, if you get a Bingo next move you win the InstaPot!   The InstaPot collects the antes of each missed InstaBingo try.

This game is very new and feedback of (almost) any sort is welcome.  Contact us at bingochessdev@gmail.com.

Thanks,
